# EZ-Express

## About
EZ Express is a template for the [Express Framework](https://expressjs.com/)

## Why
I made EZ Express in the same spirit as [Flask CS](https://github.com/deXOR0/Flask-CS), this should serve as an easy, repeatable, and light-weight starting point for any Express-based project.

## How it works
I have included some essential node packages such as
- express *(duh)*
- nodemon
- ejs
- mysql2
- sequelize

In addition, this template is also equipped with Bootstrap 5

Some example files had been included as a cheat-sheet to further assist your project development.

## Prerequisites
- Node v15.0.1 +
- npm 7.0.3 +

## How to use
- Clone this repository
- Install the dependencies
    ```
    npm i
    ```
- Install [sequelize-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize-cli) to help setup migrations and models
    ```
    npm i -D -g sequelize-cli
    ```
- Start the project with this command
    ```
    npm run dev
    ```
    
## To-Do
- [ ] Include validator (currently doing some limited testing on [yup](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yup))
- [ ] Include security packages (think [helmet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/helmet) etc)
- [ ] Setup cors (?)
- [ ] Provide support for mongodb or no sql in general (maybe something like [monk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/monk)?)
